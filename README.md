## Neetcode

### Problem 1 - Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 3]
Output: true

### Problem 2 - Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false. An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"
Output: false
